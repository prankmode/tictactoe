# tic Tac TOE!!

This is a super exciting game.  Have a go.  You won't be able to stop!

The only thing is you have to create an account and sign in before you can play.
Yes, I am collecting all your user data and selling it to whoever wants it.  So
make sure you use an email address where you can be tracked down.

## What's it made of?

HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript.  Uses a backend Rails server that I had nothing
to do with.

## How I made it

Only by having long experience with this game was I able to reproduce it for you.

First, I got all the account stuff done.  Sign up/sign in, etc.

Then I worked on the game API stuff - creating a game and saving it.

Then I worked on the user interface and the game logic together.  For the UI,
I wondered whether to use Bootstrap
columns or buttons or list elements or a table for the grid.  In the end, I
used a table.  That seemed to work out pretty easily.
